# Gift-Picker
A small tool to pair gift givers and recipients for Secret Santa


The most current version is `python-picker`. It's written with only modules from the standard library, so it should be usable on any Python 3.7+ installation. Each version has its own Readme with instructions.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions!
